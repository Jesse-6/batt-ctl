This application is (as of 2026-01-03), now version 0.2!

Changes:
  - add support for Lenovo control method (boolean);
  - add support for raw method, which may cover any apparently unsupported so far control method;
  - percentage mode is now called 'linear';
  - add 'LOG' directive support for config file, allowing to log to output any message during service run;
  - '-ol' supports linear, boolean and raw mode, with autodetection (fallback to raw mode);
  - enhanced safety and sanity about linear and boolean methods to avoid many problems;
  - version 0.1 config file is not supported yet: use the provided version 0.2 only.
