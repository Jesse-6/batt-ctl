#### List of things to be done:
 
  - make a -query (-ql) for non sudo limit reads; [DONE!]
  - (backlog) make interpreter ignore spaces and tabs in between tokens on configuration files;
  - make service autogenerate an optimized (secondary) config file based on what if could successfully write, and use this file instead of the default search config file on next service run;
  - (backlog) support other init systems, like: runit, s6 and sysvinit.
